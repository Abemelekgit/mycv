      <p>
        I'm Abemelek Negusu Lemma, a lifelong tech enthusiast who fell in love with computers and software as a child. I previously completed an engineering degree and I'm currently finishing a Bachelor of Computer Science (expected mid-February 2026). I enjoy building polished, user-focused frontend experiences and reliable full-stack systems.

      <p>
        I am targeting frontend engineering roles where I can apply React, Next.js, and modern UI tooling to build performant and accessible applications. I bring curiosity, strong fundamentals in data structures and algorithms, and a dedication to writing maintainable code.
