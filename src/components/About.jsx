      <p>
        I'm Abemelek Negusu Lemma, a lifelong tech enthusiast who fell in love with computers and software as a child. I previously completed an engineering degree and I'm currently finishing a Bachelor of Computer Science (expected mid-February 2026). I enjoy building polished, user-focused frontend experiences and reliable full-stack systems.

        I am targeting frontend engineering roles where I can apply React, Next.js, and modern UI tooling to build performant and accessible applications. I bring curiosity, strong fundamentals in data structures and algorithms, and a dedication to writing maintainable code. I believe teamwork is essential for success in any project, and I thrive in collaborative environments where ideas are shared and everyone contributes to achieving the best results.

        I’m especially interested in contributing at Diligence Technologies in Addis Ababa. Your focus as a leading ICT solutions provider in Ethiopia—pairing a customer‑centric approach with innovation for enterprise clients—aligns with my strengths in building reliable, secure, and scalable web applications. I value teamwork, clear communication, and delivering user‑focused solutions that make a measurable difference.
