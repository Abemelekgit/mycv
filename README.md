# My CV (React)

This is a small, aesthetic React CV site scaffolded with Vite. It includes components for header, about, experience, education, skills, projects and contact.

What I created for you:
- A Vite + React project structure in this folder.
- Components with placeholders and an aesthetic glass/gradient theme.

What I need from you to finish and personalize the CV:
1. A high-resolution photo (place it at `public/avatar.jpg`).
2. A PDF resume if you want the "Download Resume" button to work (place at `public/resume.pdf`).
3. Answer the questions below so I can fill in the content and tune the design:
   - What exact job title(s) are you targeting? (e.g., Frontend Engineer, Full-Stack, Software Engineer)
   - List your main technical skills and your proficiency (e.g., JavaScript - Advanced, React - Intermediate).
   - Any internships, jobs, or volunteer work to list? Include role, organization, dates, and 2–4 bullet points of achievements.
   - Top 2–4 projects you want showcased (title, short description, tech, link if any).
   - Preferred contact email, LinkedIn URL, GitHub URL, phone (optional), and location (city/country).
   - Any awards, certificates, or languages to highlight?
   - Do you want the CV to be downloadable as a one-page PDF? (I can add a print stylesheet or export setup.)

   I added a "Save as PDF" button in the header which triggers the browser print dialog using a print-optimized stylesheet. To export a one-page PDF, open the site, click "Save as PDF", choose "Save as PDF" or your PDF printer, and set layout to Portrait. You can also use the browser's "Print -> Save as PDF".

How to run locally:

```bash
# make sure you have Node.js installed (>=16)
cd /home/abemelek/Documents/reactjs/mycv
npm install
npm run dev
```

After you provide the photo and the answers above, I will:
- Update the site content with your real data.
- Improve the layout for mobile and accessibility tweaks.
- Optionally add a print stylesheet to export a polished one-page PDF CV.

If you want, I can also:
- Add Tailwind for faster styling, or a CMS connection to edit content.
- Deploy to Vercel/Netlify and set up a custom domain.

Reply with your photo (upload it here) and the answers to the questions above and I’ll finish the page content and polish visuals.
